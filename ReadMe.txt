Heyo, I did a stupid and uploaded one of my projects to main. This isn't an updated version go check the branches for each project.

Note: All of these are moderate scale solo adventures. So theres not a lot of commenting and csvs are pretty messy. Please, read R files and python files first and go by what you figure out in those.
