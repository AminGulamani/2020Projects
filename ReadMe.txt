Heyo, I did a stupid and uploaded one of my projects to main. This isn't an updated version go check the branches for each project.

Note: All of these are moderate scale solo adventures. So theres not a lot of commenting and csvs are pretty messy. Please, read R files and python files first and go by what you figure out in those.

If you are running any of these: projects require one program be ran before the other. Please pay attention for dependencies like that. Also all python was ran in pycharm hence the weird saving style.
